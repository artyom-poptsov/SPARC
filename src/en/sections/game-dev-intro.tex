Playing computer games is a very entertaining activity that can make you
occupied for many hours.  But what if we want to build your own game?  In fact,
it is not so hard to create small games, even if you have just basic skills in
programming.  And the process of developing games can be no less entertaining
than playing games!

The purpose of this chapter is to guide us through the process of development of
simple games on Arduino, mainly for the sake of consolidation of learned
material.  The advantage of such approach is that we can easily come up with
many game development tasks, and while solving them we can learn how to use
known language instructions.  Also sometimes we will be facing with uncharted
territories of programming lands which in turn will push us to learn new topics,
helping our skills to grow.
