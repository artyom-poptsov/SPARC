Dear reader, welcome to our cozy club of tinkerers and makers.  Here we are
learning how to work with sound, light, electricity by applying our knowledge
and skills to create unexpected, interesting and practical projects.  We will
try to make your journey to the world of electronics and programming as
interesting as we can and will try to lead you around the bumps on the road
where it's possible.  But you'll have certain responsibilities too.  First of
all our efforts will not give you the desired results without your involvement
in the process.  Second, we are learning with you as well -- and you, dear
reader, can become an active contributor to our work.  If you'll find any typos
and errors (or, as programmers say, ``bugs'') in the book, please don't hesitate
to report all bugs to us.  We'll try our best to fix all bugs in the next
version of the book.

We are hoping that this book will become your fellow traveler for a while, that
will help you to grasp the art of programming and gave you new insights about
the physical world around you.
