In this section we are going to make the player to look in the direction of the
movement.  For this we have to create tree variants of the player ``model'': the
first one where the player stays idle; the second, where the player looks to the
right, and the third where the player looks to the left.

To save precious storage space for custom characters in the LCD memory, we will
be using the same symbol code, only changing the image of the symbol.
