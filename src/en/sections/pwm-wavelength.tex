When we programmed our ``blinking lights'' project, we supplied to a digital
port signals \texttt{HIGH} and \texttt{LOW} alternately, with a delay specified
in microseconds.  If we take a look on the signal value in relation to the time
on a digital port (e.g. using an oscilloscope) we will get a graph similar to
fig. \ref{fig:blinking-led-graph}.

Where \emph{period length} is the distance between the two adjacent points in
time, where oscillations occur in the same phase.  If we know the period length
we can calculate the \emph{oscillation frequency}, and vice versa -- if we know
the frequency we can calculate the wavelength.
