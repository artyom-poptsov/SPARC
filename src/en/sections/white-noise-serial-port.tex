\label{section:serial-port}

Connection of Arduino to a computer is usually is done through a USB connector
placed on the board.  On the Arduino Mega 2560 side USB-B is used for that
purpose.

The USB protocol is quite complicated and the most of the Arduino chips don't
``speak'' USB protocol and need a ``translator'' to be understood by a computer.
A translator is usually a separate chip called USB-UART converter soldered on an
Arduino board.  We will discuss UART in a section
\ref{section:communication-uart}.  Some compact Arduino such as Arduino Pro Mini
does not have its own USB-UART converter and require a separate converter.

An USB-UART converter emulates a simpler data transfer protocol than USB that is
commonly known as ``Serial Port''.  On old computers this port (also known as
COM-port) was represented as a separate interface on the main board and was used
to connect such devices as computer mice.  COM-ports used to be quite widespread
back in the days (for example they were popular on IBM PC AT computers.)  In the
modern world COM-ports were replaced in most of the consumer electronics with
other standards, mostly USB.  But COM-ports are still in use today on
specialized equipment.

One of the examples where serial ports are used to this day is working with
microcontrollers.  USB-UART converter emulates a COM-port for a computer
allowing to ``communicate'' with a microcontroller using a simpler language than
USB.  Thus for a computer an Arduino looks like a COM-port despite that the
physical connection is done through a USB.  Using this line of communication we
can transfer data from a computer to an Arduino and vice versa.

We will discuss serial ports in more detail in the section
\ref{section:communication-serial-port}.  Currently we only need the basic
knowledge on this topic in order to understand the examples in chapter.
