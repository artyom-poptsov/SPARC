\section{Rhythm theory}
\index{Music!Rhythm}

Our way to the music starts from the discussion of the \emph{rhythm theory}.
Most of us know that the rhythm is -- in many people it produces the reflex of
head nodding to the rhythm, or mechanical finger tapping on a tabletop to the
rhythm beats.

To understand how a rhythm is created we need to know some basic things about
the rhythm theory which will discuss below.

\subsection{The \emph{musical bar}}
\index{Music!Rhythm!Scale}

Let's start with a musical joke: \footnote{A variation of the joke from
\url{https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/humour/long-bar-notes-joke/}}

\begin{quotation}
C, E-flat and G walk into a bar.  The bartender says, ``Sorry, but we donâ€™t
serve minors.''
\end{quotation}

Any musical composition is divided into time measures also known as \emph{bars}
-- usually of the same length. \footnote{Music has great variety and compositors
come up with the new tricks all the time that allow them to make the desired
impression on the listeners.  So here we are discussing the topic with some
assumptions.}

On the fig. \ref{fig:music-six-bar} we can see how could a musical composition
consisting of six bars look.

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thick, ->] (0, 0.5) -- (12, 0.5) node[anchor=north west] {t};
  \foreach \x/\n in {0/1, 2/2, 4/3, 6/4, 8/5, 10/6} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 1) -- (\x, 1) node[midway, above] {\n};
  };
  \label{fig:music-six-bar}
\end{tikzpicture}

The length of one bar in time is determined by the tempo of the rhythm, and we
will discuss this later.  For now, we can imagine that one one bar always takes
one abstract unit of time.  We can substitute this unit of time with any
convenient time duration -- such as one second.

Those bars are divided into smaller parts that used as cells to lay down
different sounds.  Great part of music is interweaved with mathematics, and the
first mathematical thing we face is the simple fraction.  One of the popular
ways to divide a bar is to use $\frac{4}{4}$ -- or ``four-four'' time.  In this
case a bar holds four parts, and each of which has $\frac{1}{4}$ length -- that
makes $\frac{1}{1}$ in total (or just 1.)  \footnote{There are more complicated
ways of bar division that can produce bars that are less than or more than 1 in
length.  We will talk about it later.}

If we divide a bar into four equal parts, we will get the following structure:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thick, ->] (0, 0.5) -- (12, 0.5) node[anchor=north west] {t};
  \foreach \x/\n in {0/1, 2/2, 4/3, 6/4, 8/5, 10/6} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 1) -- (\x, 1) node[midway, above] {\n};
  };

  \foreach \x/\n in {0, 0.5, ..., 10} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 0.5);
  };
\end{tikzpicture}

Let's take one of the bars and investigate it closely:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thick] (0, 0.5) -- (8, 0.5) node[anchor=north west] {t};
  \foreach \x/\n in {0/1, 8/2} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 1)  -- (\x, 1) node[midway, above] {\n};
  };

  \foreach \x in {0, 2, ..., 6} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 0.5) node[pos=0.25, right] {$ \frac{1}{4} $};
  };
\end{tikzpicture}

If we add all the parts together we will get one:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{1}
\end{equation}

We can put a sound into each of the bar segments -- for now, it does not matter
if this sound is ``musical''.  Let's assume that three of the four segments will
produce a 50\gls{Hz} sound, and the last one will produce 100Hz sound:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thick] (0, 0.5) -- (8, 0.5) node[anchor=north west] {t};
  \foreach \x/\n in {0/1, 8/2} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 1) -- (\x, 1) node[midway, above] {\n};
  };

  \foreach \x in {0, 2, ..., 6} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 0.5) node[pos=0.25, right] {$ \frac{1}{4} $};
  };

  \foreach \x/\freq in {0/50, 2/50, 4/50, 6/100} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 0.5) node[pos=1.5, right] {\freq Hz};
  };
\end{tikzpicture}

Congratulations!  We just made a simple rhythm.
