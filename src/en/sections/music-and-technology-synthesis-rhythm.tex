\section{Rhythm theory}
\index{Music!Rhythm}

Our way into the music starts from the discussion of the \emph{rhythm theory}.
Most of us know what the rhythm is -- in many people it produces the reflex of
head nodding to the rhythm, or mechanical finger tapping on a tabletop to the
rhythm beats.

To understand how a rhythm is created we need to know some basic things about
the rhythm theory which will discuss below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The \emph{musical bar}}
\index{Music!Rhythm!Bar}

Let's start with a musical joke: \footnote{A variation of the joke from
\url{https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/humour/long-bar-notes-joke/}}

\begin{quotation}
C, E-flat and G walk into a bar.  The bartender says, ``Sorry, but we don’t
serve minors.''
\end{quotation}

Any musical composition is divided into time measures also known as \emph{bars}
-- usually of the same length. \footnote{Music has great variety and compositors
come up with the new tricks all the time that allow them to make the desired
impression on the listeners.  So here we are discussing the topic with some
assumptions.}

On the fig. \ref{fig:music-six-bar} we can see how can a musical composition
consisting of six bars look.

\figureMusicSixBars{en}

The length of one bar in time is determined by the tempo of the rhythm, and we
will discuss this later.  For now, we can imagine that one bar always takes one
abstract unit of time.  We can substitute this unit of time with any convenient
time duration -- such as one second.

Those bars are divided into smaller parts that are used as cells to lay down
different sounds.  Great part of music is interweaved with mathematics, and the
first mathematical thing we face is the simple fraction.  One of the popular
ways to divide a bar is to use $\frac{4}{4}$ -- or ``four-four'' time.  In this
case a bar holds four parts, and each of which has $\frac{1}{4}$ length -- that
makes $\frac{1}{1}$ in total (or just 1.)  \footnote{There are more complicated
ways of bar division that can produce bars that are less than or more than 1 in
length.  We will talk about it later.}

If we divide a bar into four equal parts, we will get the following structure:

\figureMusicSixBarsFourFour{en}

Let's take one of the bars and investigate it closely:

\figureMusicBarFourFour{en}

If we add all the parts together we will get one:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{1}
\end{equation}

We can put a sound into each of the bar segments -- for now, it does not matter
if this sound is ``musical''.  Let's assume that three of the four segments will
produce a 50\gls{Hz} sound, and the last one will produce 100Hz sound:

\figureMusicBarFourFourWithFrequencies{en}

Congratulations!  We just made a simple rhythm.  Let's program with the bar
length \texttt{T} equal to 1 second, or 1000000 microseconds.

Between the beats we should add a short delay (e.g. 100 ms) so the sounds of the
same frequency that go one after another won't be glued together.

\begin{minted}{cpp}
  // The digital port number where a speaker is connected.
  const int SPEAKER = 2;

  void setup() {
    pinMode(SPEAKER, OUTPUT);
  }

  // The procedure that generates a sound with the
  // specified parameters.
  void play_tone(int port, float f, long t) {
    const int T = 1000000 / f;
    int d = T / 2;
    int count = t / T;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      digitalWrite(port, HIGH);
      delayMicroseconds(d);
      digitalWrite(port, LOW);
      delayMicroseconds(d);
    }
  }

  void loop() {
    const long T = 1000000; // The length of the bar (1s)
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50,  T / 4); // A quarter
    delay(100); // The delay between the sounds.
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50,  T / 4); // A quarter
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50,  T / 4); // A quarter
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 100, T / 4); // A quarter
    delay(100);
  }
\end{minted}

Now we can do something more complicated.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{More complicated rhythms}

Probably some of us know this very well-known composition ``We Will Rock You''
by Queen\footnote{The official video for the composition can be found here:
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tJYN-eG1zk}}.

This composition has clear, easily recognizable rhythm, that in simple terms can
be described as ``two beats, one clap''.  The whole composition is built around
this rhythm -- you can perform this rhythm by making two short foot stumps on the
floor and one long clap with hands.

\figureMusicWeWillRockYouSimplified{en}

The structure of the rhythm can be described by the sequence of simple fractions
(see fig. \ref{fig:queen-we-will-rock-you-rhythm-1}.)  The sound frequencies are
chosen by us arbitrarily.

As we can see from the fig. \ref{fig:queen-we-will-rock-you-rhythm-1}, division
of a bar don't have to be uniform -- here we have two quarters and one half.  To
add simple fractions together we have to convert them to the common denominator.
And we end up with one in the end (see the equation
\ref{equation:queen-we-will-rock-you-rhythm-1}.)

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
  \label{equation:queen-we-will-rock-you-rhythm-1}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Musical rhythm notation}

From the point of the musical notation the rhythm from
fig. \ref{fig:queen-we-will-rock-you-rhythm-1} can be written down as is shown
on fig. \ref{fig:lilypond-queen-1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{lilypond}
    \relative c' {
      \numericTimeSignature
      \time 4/4
      e,4 e4 e'2
    }
  \end{lilypond}
  \caption{The rhythm of the melody ``We Will Rock You'' in the musical notation
    (simplified version.)}
  \label{fig:lilypond-queen-1}
\end{figure}

We haven't discussed the musical notation yet so the figure
\ref{fig:lilypond-queen-1} can be completely obscure for us -- but don't worry,
on this stage we just have to see that there are three symbols written on the
lines.  Each symbol represents a sound of the specific length: ``\quarterNote''
($\frac{1}{4}$), ``\quarterNote'' ($\frac{1}{4}$) и ``\halfNote''
($\frac{1}{2}$).

The order of those symbols (from left to right) shows the order of playing of
those sounds, and the form of the symbol shows the length of the sound as per
the table \ref{table:music-notes-legths}.

\tableMusicNoteLength{en}

There are even shorter and longer notes, but they occur less frequent than those
we listed in the table \ref{table:music-notes-legths}, so we won't discuss to
make the material more concise.

What conclusions we can make form the things we discussed above?  In the musical
notation sounds that can be ``produced'' from a musical instrument, are written
from left to right (as the regular English text.)

We can place our musical sheet on the top of a graph to make it clearer for our
understanding.  The $\mbox{X}$ axis represents the time going form left to
right:

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{lilypond}
    \relative c' {
      \numericTimeSignature
      \time 4/4
      e,4 e4 e'2
    }
  \end{lilypond}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick, ->] (0, 0.5) -- (12, 0.5) node[anchor=north east] {Time};
  \end{tikzpicture}

  \caption{A musical ``graph''.}
  \label{fig:lilypond-queen-1}
\end{figure}

From the point of programming the source code for making such a rhythm can look
like follows:

\begin{minted}{cpp}
  // Here we skipped the previous code that does
  // the required preparations for making a sound,
  // and the implementation of "play_tone".

  void loop() {
    // The bar length in microseconds
    const long T = 1000000;

    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 4); // Quarter
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 4); // Quarter
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 100, T / 2); // Half
    delay(100);
  }
\end{minted}

Now we have to figure out how to properly calculate the length of the bar to get
the lengths of its sub-divisions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Music tempo}
\index{Music!Rhythm!Beats per minute (BPM)}
\newglossaryentry{BPM}{name=BPM, description={Beats Per Minute}}

To put it simply, the \emph{tempo} is the speed of performing a music
composition.  In the modern music the tempo is measured in \emph{beats per
minute}, or \emph{BPM}.

The stable music tempo can be maintained with the help of a special pendulum
that swings from side to side with the consistent speed, making ``clicks'' on
each swing.  Such a pendulum called a \emph{metronome}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Metronome}
  \caption{A mechanical metronome (source:
    \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metronome_(PSF).png}).}
  \label{fig:sound-metronome}
\end{figure}

In the modern world the role of the mechanical pendulum is usually played a
special compact electronic device, or even an application for a smartphone, that
produces audible clicks according to the specified speed.

The more beats per minute, the faster the tempo -- and the faster the rhythm.
Some common examples of \gls{BPM} are: 60, 80 and 100 BPM.

But how to link this tempo speed with the bar length?  It turns out that the
uniform metronome beats set the quarter-note length ($\frac{1}{4}$.)

Thus when the rhythm tempo set to 100 BPM it means that we have 100 quarters in
one minute.

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thick] (0, 0.5) -- (10, 0.5) node[anchor=north west] {t};
  \draw (0, -0.5) -- (0, 1.5);
  \draw (10, -0.5) -- (10, 1.5);
  \draw (1, 1.5) node[anchor=north west] {1 minute (60 seconds) / 100 beats};
  \foreach \x in {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 10.0} {
    \draw (\x, 0) -- (\x, 1);
  };
\end{tikzpicture}

The distance between two beats can be calculated using the formula
\ref{equation:bpm}.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{60 \mbox{s}}{100 \mbox{beats}} = 0.6 \mbox{s} = 60 \mbox{ms} = 60000 \mu\mbox{s}
  \label{equation:bpm}
\end{equation}

From the formula \ref{equation:bpm} we got the length of one quarter which is
0.6s.  But to make the further calculations easier we need to get the length of
the whole bar instead of the quarter.  As a bar that we use in our examples
holds four quarters we need to multiply the length of one quarter by four to get
the whole bar length (see the formula \ref{equation:whole-note-calcualtion-1}.)

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{4} * 4 = \frac{4}{4} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
  \label{equation:whole-note-calcualtion-1}
\end{equation}

Given that we can derive the basic formula
\ref{equation:whole-note-calcualtion-2} for the calculation of the whole bar
length.

\begin{equation}
  \mbox{Whole bar length} = \frac{60 \mbox{s}}{\mbox{BPM}} * 4
  \label{equation:whole-note-calcualtion-2}
\end{equation}

Now we can musically precise calculate the length of our sounds that compose our
rhythm -- including for the composition ``We Will Rock You'' that we discussed
above.  For this composition tempo is set to 86 BPM. \footnote{In different
sources the BPM for this composition may vary, but usually it's between 84 and
88 BPM.}

Let's try to program the melody.

\begin{minted}{cpp}
  // Port to which a speaker is connected.
  const int SPEAKER = 2;

  void setup() {
    pinMode(SPEAKER, OUTPUT);
  }

  // The procedure to generate a sound with the
  // specified parameters.
  void play_tone(int port, float f, long t) {
    const int T = 1000000 / f;
    int d = T / 2;
    int count = t / T;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      digitalWrite(port, HIGH);
      delayMicroseconds(d);
      digitalWrite(port, LOW);
      delayMicroseconds(d);
    }
  }

  void loop() {
    const int BPM = 86;

    // One minute in microseconds.
    const long MINUTE = 60000000;

    // The whole bar length in microseconds.
    const long T = (MINUTE / BPM) * 4;

    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 4); // Quarter
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 4); // Quarter
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 100, T / 2); // Half
    delay(100);
  }
\end{minted}

But if we upload this project to an Arduino we can notice that the rhythm is too
slow, comparing to the original melody.  That's because we haven't consider one
important thing here -- in the composition we must squeeze the pattern ``two
beats, one clap'' twice in one bar (as is shown on
fig. \ref{fig:lilypond-queen-2}.)

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{lilypond}
    \relative c' {
      \numericTimeSignature
      \time 4/4
      e,8 e8 e'4 e,8 e8 e'4
    }
  \end{lilypond}
  \caption{The rhythm of ``We Will Rock You'' song (the full version.)}
  \label{fig:lilypond-queen-2}
\end{figure}

That's the reason why the original song feels faster -- not because the BPM is
higher, but because the notes are shorter.

Let's fix our code accordingly.

\begin{minted}{cpp}
  // ...

  void loop() {
    const int BPM = 80;

    // One minute in microseconds.
    const long MINUTE = 60000000;

    // The whole bar length in microseconds.
    const long T = (MINUTE / BPM) * 4;

    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 8); // Eighth
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 8); // Eighth
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 100, T / 4); // Quarter
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 8); // Eighth
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 50, T / 8); // Eighth
    delay(100);
    play_tone(SPEAKER, 100, T / 4); // Quarter
    delay(100);
  }
\end{minted}

The rhythm is ready, but we are still choosing the frequencies for our
``instruments'' arbitrarily.  It is time to fix that as well.
