\section{Control Flow}

Statements (or so called \emph{operators}) of a programming language that are
responsible for the controlling the flow of program execution are called
\emph{control flow statements}.  They include \emph{branching} statements,
\emph{loop} statements and others alike.  Generally we can say that if a
statement changes the sequential flow of execution of a program then this
statement is one of the control flow statements group.

In this section we will discuss the main types of the control flow statements
that are present in C++ and many other popular programming languages.

\subsection{Conditionals}
\index{Programming!Conditionals}

Sometimes a program needs to decide what to do next in the runtime.  For a
computer to choose the right way to go we (the programmers) need to describe a
conditional statement in the program code: if a logical expression is true then
we do one thing, if it is not -- we do something other.

Conditional statements are described using special control flow statements.  In
C++ we have two main statements.  The first one is \texttt{if} operator.

Here's an example:

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{cpp}
    int a = 42;
    if (a > 10) {
      // A code that is executed only when the value of "a'' variable
      // is greater than 10.  In this case this code will always
      // be executing because the variable is always equals to 42.
    }
  \end{minted}
  \label{listing:dialogues-with-computer-if-more-than}
  \caption{Example of (\texttt{if}) usage to check if the variable value is
    greater than 10.}
\end{listing}

When we need to check if a variable value is equal to some other value we use
``=='' (strict equal) as shown on the listing
\ref{listing:dialogues-with-computer-if-equals}.

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{cpp}
    int a = 42;
    if (a == 10) {
      // A sequence of commands that will be executed if
      // the 'a' value is equal to 10.  In this example this
      // piece of code will never be executed as the variable
      // value is always 42 and will never be 10.
    }
  \end{minted}
  \label{listing:dialogues-with-computer-if-equals}
  \caption{An example of usage of \texttt{if} to check if the variable value is
    equal to 10.}
\end{listing}

\note{ Don't confuse \emph{equality operator} ``=='' with \emph{assignment
  operator} ``='' -- this is important!  The point is that in many cases C/C++
  programming languages allow to use either of the operators in one place
  interchangeably but the results will be completely different depending on the
  used operator.  In C++ ``='' symbol has different roles but if we are talking
  about working with variables then this operator is always changes the variable
  that is on the left of assignment operator. }

The easiest way to remember the difference between those two operations is that
single ``='' sign means assignment and ``=='' is equality operator.

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{cpp}
    int a = 42;
    if (a = 10) {
      // This sequence of commands will always be executed
      // as the ``a = 10'' stores 10 in ``a'' variable so
      // the value of the overall expression is 10 which means
      // ``true'' in C/C++.
    }
  \end{minted}
  \label{listing:dialogues-with-computer-if-equals-assignment}
  \caption{An example of the error that is introduced into the code by using
    ``='' instead of ``==''.}
\end{listing}

In the listing \ref{listing:dialogues-with-computer-if-equals-assignment} the
\texttt{if} body will always be executed a despite the fact that \texttt{a} is
equal to 42 before \texttt{if} -- the reason for that is that the assignment
operator inside the parenthesis \emph{changes} the value of \texttt{a} to 10.
Then \texttt{a} variable is substituted with its value inside the parenthesis.
In C/C++ Boolean values are just numbers: zero is ``false'', any other value is
considered as ``true''.  Which means that the number 10 means ``true'' as well
when is used as a value in logical expressions.

Often you need to provide not only the code to be executed if the condition
inside \texttt{if} parenthesis is true, but also some code that needs to be
executed when the condition is false.  In such cases one can use
\texttt{if..else} statement:

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{cpp}
    int a = 42;
    if (a > 10) {
      // Some code that needs to be executed when
      // the value of 'a' is greater than 10.
    } else {
      // Code that is executed when 'a' value is less
      // or equal to 10.
    }
  \end{minted}
  \label{listing:dialogues-with-computer-if-with-else}
  \caption{An example of (\texttt{if}) usage with \texttt{else} block.}
\end{listing}

Another statement that is often used is \texttt{switch..case} also known as
\emph{multiple choice operator}.  This statement is convenient when it comes to
choosing from multiple cases of a variable value.

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{cpp}
    int a = 42;
    switch (a) {
      case 10:
      // A set of instructions to be executed
      // when 'a' value equals to 10.
      break;
      case 42:
      // A set of instructions to be executed
      // when 'a' value equals to 42.
      break;
      case 20:
      // A set of instructions to be executed
      // when 'a' value equals to 20.
      case 30:
      // A set of instructions to be executed
      // when 'a' value equals to either 20 or 30.
      break;
      case 1:
      case 2:
      // A set of instructions to be executed
      // when 'a' value equals to 1 or 2.
      break;
      default:
      // A set of instructions to be executed
      // when 'a' does not match with any of the
      // cases described above.
    }
  \end{minted}
