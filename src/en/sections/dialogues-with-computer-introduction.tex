\section{Introduction}

We think that programming has two sides: on one hand it is one of the kinds of
creativity that allows to build something new, unconventional and probably
useful for the society; on the other hand it is a tool that allows to solve
practical, applied tasks.  As brushes and paints of a painter or instruments of
a musician, instruments of a programmer have great variability in kinds and
their applications.  One has to spent years to fully learn those tools.
Nevertheless a long road starts with the first step.

This chapter will help people who want to learn programming to make the first
step on their journey of programmer profession.  We invite you to learn the
basics of C/C++ programming by developing applications for Arduino platform.
