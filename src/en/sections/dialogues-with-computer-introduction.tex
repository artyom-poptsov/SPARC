\section{Introduction}

In some sense, programming has two sides: on one hand it is one of the kinds of
creativity that allows us to build something new, unconventional and probably
useful for society; on the other hand it is a tool that allows us to solve
practical, applied tasks.  As brushes and paints of a painter or instruments of
a musician, instruments of a programmer have great variability in kinds and
their applications.  One has to spent years to fully learn those tools.
Nevertheless a long road starts with the first step.

This chapter will help people who want to learn programming to take the first
step on their journey to become a programmer.  We invite you to learn the basics
of C/C++ programming by developing applications for Arduino platform.
