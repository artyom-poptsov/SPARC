\section{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a program that slowly turns an LED on and off.  Build a circuit with
  one LED, test it with the program.
\item Write a program that does ``blinking lights'' effect using PWM.  Build a
  circuit with at least five LEDs and test the program.
\item Using a potentiometer, modify the circuit from the previous task to allow
  to control the brightness of the ``chasing lights''.
\item Develop a ``blinking lights'' effect where the next LED in the sequence
  starts to slowly turn on simultaneously with the dimming of the current one.
\end{enumerate}
