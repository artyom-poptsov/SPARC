\section{Structures}
\index{Programming!Structures}

When we are developing complex projects, such as computer games, it is important
to keep the source code structured.  As we saw before, some of the auxiliary
game procedures accept two or even more parameters.  Also now we are operating
with such complex entities as ``Player'', ``Game map'', ``Game object'' and so
on.

In such conditions, passing separate variables that describe some concrete
object to procedures does not seem like a good idea.  It would be better to
group, for example, player coordinates and their health points into some complex
object that we can pass to procedures for processing.
